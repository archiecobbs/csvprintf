csvprintf is a simple UNIX command line utility for parsing CSV files.

cvsprintf works just like the printf(1) command line utility. You
supply a printf(1) format string on the command line and each record
in the CSV file is formatted accordingly. Each format specifier in
the format string contains a column accessor to specify which CSV
column to use, so for example '%3$d' would format the third column
as a decimal value.

csvprintf can also convert CSV files into XML and JSON documents
and Bash variable assignments suitable for eval(1).
