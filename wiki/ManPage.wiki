CSVPRINTF(1)                         BSD General Commands Manual                        CSVPRINTF(1)

NAME
     csvprintf -- Simple CSV file parser for the UNIX command line

SYNOPSIS
     csvprintf [-i] [-q char] [-s char] [-f file] format

     csvprintf [-i] [-q char] [-s char] [-f file] [-e enc] -x

     xml2csv [file.xml]

DESCRIPTION
     csvprintf is a simple UNIX command line utility for parsing CSV files.

     csvprintf works like the printf(1) command line utility.  You supply a printf(1) format string
     on the command line and each record of the CSV file is formatted accordingly.  Each format
     specifier in the format string is required to start with a column accessor to specify which CSV
     column to use.

     The column accessor is a sequence of decimal digits followed by the ``$'' character (the same
     accessor format supported by printf(1)).  So for example, ``%3$d'' would format the third CSV
     column as a decimal value.  In addition, the ``%0$d'' specifier will print the number of col-
     umns in the record.

     Under the hood, csvprintf invokes the printf(1) executable on each CSV row it parses.

     csvprintf can also convert CSV files into XML documents.  The xml2csv command converts XML doc-
     uments so generated back into CSV files.

OPTIONS
     -e      Specify input character encoding.  By default, ISO-8859-1 is assumed.  This option only
             affects XML mode.

     -f      Read CSV input from the specified file.  By default (or if ``-'' is specified),
             csvprintf reads from standard input.

     -i      Ignore the very first CSV record in the input (typically contains column names).

     -q      Specify an alternate CSV column quote character.  The usual backslash escape sequences
             are accepted.  The default quote character is double quote.

     -s      Specify an alternate CSV column separator character.  The usual backslash escape
             sequences are accepted.  The default separator character is comma.

     -h      Output usage message and exit.

     -v      Output version information and exit.

     -x      Convert the CSV input into an XML document.  If the input character encoding is other
             than ISO-8859-1, specify using the -e flag.

CSV FORMAT
     csvprintf parses according to the format described by ``The Comma Separated Value (CSV) File
     Format'' (see below).  In particular, quote characters must be escaped with an extra quote and
     whitespace surrounding column values is ignored.

EXIT STATUS
     csvprintf will exit with a status 1 if invalid CSV input is detected.  Otherwise, if an invoca-
     tion of printf(1) fails, processing stops and that exit value is returned.

FILES
     /usr/share/csvprintf/csv.xsl
             XSL transform that converts XML back into CSV format.
